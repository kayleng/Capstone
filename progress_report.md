1) Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?

> Yes, obtained dataset with fundus images of btoh eyes of 3500 participants (i.e. 7000 images in total). But might remove some due to low quality image taken (might reduce to 6500+ images).

2) Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?

> Not yet. Still in the progress of data cleaning.
Might have to resize and crop images (aspect ratio)
Need more work on image preprocessing (applying filters?)
Convert to array for modelling.

3) Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
> Not yet


4) What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?

> Might require use of AWS.
Have not attempted on inputing image data into models.


5) Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?

> Yes there is a change of topic but data in hand.



6) What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?

> Complete preprocessing stage and move on to complete at least one round of modelling?


7) What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?
We will use your progress report as a leaping off point for a deep 1:1 with a member of the instructional staff. The best use of your time is to really flesh out this document so that your remaining time here can be most productive.
